		<h2>History</h2>
		
		<p>Training Zone is the leader in all kinds of training that covers management and IT in Plongk St, Cairnsville for the last 150 years.</p>
		<p>Terrence Zonas is CEO and spokesperson for Training Zone. Here is one of his first ever training lessons, the world-famous Lecture Clash training:</p>
		<p>Anyone got a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they can be manageable. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it: </p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work. </li>
			<li>Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not enough).</li>
			<li>Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's not on the web. </li>
			<li>Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are: </li>
			<ul>
				<li>If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%. </li>
				<li>Which one are you most on top of? </li>
				<li>Which subject has the most complete lecture notes? </li>
			</ul>
			<li>Don't ask your lecturer - "did I miss anything in the lecture?" If you didn't miss anything, there'd be no point to lectures.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>While we believe the best training is done face-to-face (with us!), here are some good web sites for you to do extra work:</p>		
		<ul>
			<li>Business Philosophy from Jim Rohn: <a href="http://www.jimrohn.com">http://www.jimrohn.com/</a></li>
			<li>Inspiring true performance… Zig Ziglar: <a href="http://www.zigziglar.com/">http://www.zigziglar.com/</a></li>
