    <p>Goals:
        The goal of the website is primarily to double sales through advertising of the bakery in the website. Through specific designing of the website, it should entice young families and people to visit the bakery a buy products either on sale, or normally.
    </p>
    
    <p>Success Evaluation:
        To evaluate the success of the Tropical Treats website, a noticeable increase in sales would have to be recorded. Although a specific value has not been given, doubling the sales within a year through an increase in new and repeat customers would be a suitable goal to be achieved and one that could be checked with ease
    </p>
    
    <p>Target Audience:
        As the audience is younger, vivid colours should be used as well as colours that will suit the pictures used. As the younger audience is primarily composed of uni students and young families, the site should be intuitive and easy to use in order to keep interest and provide a positive feeling towards the bakery
